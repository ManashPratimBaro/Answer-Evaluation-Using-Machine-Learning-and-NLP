# **Answer Evaluation Using Machine Learning and NLP**

## **Overview**
This project successfully developed a system that automatically evaluates and grades answers provided by students. By leveraging machine learning algorithms and natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system analyzes the content, structure, and relevance of the answers to provide accurate and consistent grading.

- **Data Collection:** Gathered a comprehensive dataset of questions and corresponding answers with their grades.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including:
  - Tokenization
  - Removing stop words
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracted key features from the text, such as:
  - Word frequency
  - Sentence structure
  - Semantic similarity
- **Model Training:** Trained a robust machine learning model on the dataset to accurately predict grades for new answers.
- **Evaluation:** Tested the model's accuracy and performance using various metrics and refined it for optimal results.
